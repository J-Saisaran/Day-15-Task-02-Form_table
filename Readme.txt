# Day 15 Task 02: Form Submission and Table Display

This project involves creating a web form for user input and displaying the submitted data in a table. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form collects user details and preferences, which are then dynamically added to a table upon submission.

## Features

- **User Form:** Collects various pieces of information from the user, including personal details and food preferences.
- **Dynamic Table:** Displays the submitted data in a table format for easy viewing.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the form and table are displayed correctly across different screen sizes.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the form and table.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the form and table, ensuring responsiveness and a clean layout.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file responsible for handling form submissions and updating the table with user data.
